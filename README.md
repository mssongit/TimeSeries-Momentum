# TimeSeries-Momentum


This project repository implements the deep momentum network timeseries momentum factor proposed by [Lim, Zohren and Roberts (2019)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3369195).


The plot below summarizes the performance of the TSMOM-DMN factor (with and without transaction cost) against the AQR cross-sectional momentum factor and a baseline time series momentum strategy (SIGN).
